Hollywood Bollywood game in C++

This programme is the computerized version of the game “Hollywood Bollywood”. 
In this project, the computer will randomly select a movie from the database and the user will have to guess that movie by inputting the letters one by one. The user has to guess the movie till they are out of tries.

The administrator of the project can add both Hollywood and Bollywood movies in their respective files, display all of them, modify them and delete them.

This project still has some limitations and I am open to any changes which can make it better.
